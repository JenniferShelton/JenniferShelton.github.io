teaching: 10
exercises: 10
questions:
- What is a command shell and why would I use one?
objectives:
- Explain how the shell relates to the keyboard, the screen, the operating system, and usersâ€™ programs.
- Explain when and why command-line interfaces should be used instead of graphical interfaces.
keypoints:
- Many bioinformatics tools can only process large data in the command line version not the GUI.
- The shell makes your work less boring (same set of tasks with a large number of files)"
- The shell makes your work less error-prone
- The shell makes your work more reproducible.
- Many bioinformatic tasks require large amounts of computing power

When the shell is first opened, you are presented with a **prompt**,
indicating that the shell is waiting for input.

```bash
$
```


The shell typically uses `$` as the prompt, but may use a different symbol.
In the examples for this lesson, we'll show the prompt as `$`.
Most importantly, *do not type the prompt* when typing commands.
Only type the command that follows the prompt.
This rule applies both in these lessons and in lessons from other sources.
Also note that after you type a command, you have to press the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key to execute it.

The prompt is followed by a **text cursor**, a character that indicates the position where your
typing will appear.
The cursor is usually a flashing or solid block, but it can also be an underscore or a pipe.
You may have seen it in a text editor program, for example.

Note that your prompt might look a little different. In particular, most popular shell
environments by default put your user name and the host name before the `$`. Such
a prompt might look like, e.g.:

```bash
jshelton@localhost $
```

There are many ways for a user to interact with a computer. For example, we often use a Graphical User 
Interface (GUI). With a GUI we might roll a mouse to a logo of a folder and click or tap (on a touch 
screen) to show the content of that folder. In a Commandline Interface the user can do all of the same 
actions (e.g. show the content of a folder). But on the Commandline the user passes commands to the 
computer as lines of text.

- What is a Read Evaluate Print Loop (REPL)?

1. the shell presents a prompt (like `$`)
2. user types a command and presses the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key
3. the computer reads it
4. the computer executes it and prints its output (if any)
5. loop from step #4 back to step #1

```bash
$ ls
```


> ## Command not found
> 
> If the shell can't find a program whose name is the command you typed, it
> will print an error message such as:
>
> ```bash
> $ ks
> ```
> > ## Solution
> >
> > ```
> > ks: command not found
> > ```
> > {: .output}
> > This might happen if the command was mis-typed or if the program corresponding to that command
is not installed.
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}
