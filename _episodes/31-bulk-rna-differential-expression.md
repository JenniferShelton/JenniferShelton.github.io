title: "Bulk RNA differential expression"
teaching: 60
exercises: 120
questions:
- How do I normalize a bulk RNA dataset?
- How can I summarize the relationship between samples?
- How can I compare expression based on biological or technical variables?
- How can I visualize the results of this comparison?
- How can I prepare differential expression results for input into downstream tools for biological insight?
- How can I interpret the results of functional enrichment tools?
objectives:
- Apply standard bulk workflow pre-processing methods such as DESeq2 normalization given a gene-sample count matrix.
- Execute dimensional reduction (PCA) and corresponding visualization.
- Compute differential expression between two groups, controlling for a secondary variable.
- Summarize differential expression (DE) results using a heatmap visualization.
- Interpret data visualizations from the above steps.
- Use base R commands to output text files from DE results for input into functional enrichment (GO/GSEA).
- Run GO/GSEA using a web-based tool, and describe the meaning of the resulting output.
keypoints:
- Will add this later.
