title: "Structural Variation in long reads"
teaching: 60
exercises: 0
questions:
- What are the advantages/disadvantages of long reads?
- How might we leverage a combination of long and short read data?
objectives:
- Investigate how long-read data can improve SV calling.
keypoints:
- Long-reads offer significant advantages over short-reads for SV calling.
- Genotyping of long-read discovered SVs in short-read data allows for some scalability.
