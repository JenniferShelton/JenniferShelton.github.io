The [New York Genome Center](https://www.nygenome.org/) hosts annual workshops to introduce participants to using bioinformatics tools on a command line interface.

This hands-on portion of the workshop will cover basic concepts and tools, including analysis design, and task automation. Participants will be encouraged to help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems. This workshop material was adapted from Software Carpentry's workshop material. Learn more about Software Carpentry on their [website](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/). Software Carpentry's mission is to help scientists and engineers get more research done in less time and with less pain by teaching them basic lab skills for scientific computing.

 The Carpentries teaches foundational coding and data science skills to researchers worldwide. Our lessons are based on Software Carpentry, Data Carpentry, and Library Carpentry workshop lessons.
