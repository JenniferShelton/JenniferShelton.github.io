## Going forward

After the workshop make sure to exchange contact information with some other 
attendees. You will find that people who are also learning to use the commandline 
are often better at explaining core concepts to each other than people who don't 
remember what was initially confusing anymore.

Your school provides computing resources in the form of computer labs, HPC 
clusters, and/or cloud accounts. At the workshop we will discuss the availble 
options. Contact the people who offer help and support for these resources. They 
can assist you with more advanced questions and help you make the most of your 
resources. They may also be able to help host study groups for new users to work 
together. 

Reaching out to the people who setup compute resources and fellow novice users is 
about the best next step you can take. You will reienforce your own learning in 
peer discussions and your school or research groups facilitators can help keep 
you on a good course.
